Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to predict a binary outcome based on a single feature (age). 
The dataset used in this example, insurance_data.csv, contains information on whether individuals purchased insurance or not based on their age. 
The logistic regression model is trained to classify whether a person bought insurance (binary classification: 0 or 1).

Key Concepts:
Logistic Regression: A statistical technique used for binary classification, predicting a discrete outcome (such as yes/no or 1/0) based on one or more input features.
Binary Classification: In this case, the outcome is binaryâ€”whether or not an individual bought insurance.
Prediction: The model predicts whether an individual with a given age will buy insurance.
Probability: The model also calculates the probabilities of both possible outcomes (e.g., likelihood of buying or not buying insurance).

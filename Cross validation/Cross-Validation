Comparing Classifiers on Digits Dataset with Cross-Validation
This code compares multiple machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and MLP, on the digits dataset using different evaluation techniques.
It applies cross-validation, K-Folds, and Stratified K-Folds to assess model performance and explores hyperparameter tuning for models like Random Forest.

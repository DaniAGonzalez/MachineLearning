Bagging for Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Trees
This code demonstrates the application of Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) with Decision Tree classifiers to predict diabetes outcomes. 
The dataset is preprocessed with scaling, and the model is evaluated using cross-validation and out-of-bag (OOB) scoring. 
The goal is to improve prediction accuracy by reducing variance through ensemble learning.

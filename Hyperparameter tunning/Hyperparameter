Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning with SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
This code demonstrates model selection and hyperparameter tuning using the Iris dataset.
It compares different models (SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
The performance of each model is evaluated with cross-validation, and the optimal model configuration is identified for improved accuracy.

In this project, we use the **Random Forest Classifier** to classify handwritten digits from the `digits` dataset, which is provided by `sklearn.datasets`. 
After loading the data, we visualize a few of the digits as images using **matplotlib**. The data is then structured into a pandas DataFrame where each row represents a flattened image of a digit and the target variable 
(the corresponding digit label) is appended as a new column.

Next, we split the data into training and testing sets using **train_test_split** from `sklearn.model_selection`. 
The model chosen for classification is the **Random Forest Classifier** from `sklearn.ensemble`. We then train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test set, obtaining an accuracy score. 

To better understand the performance of the classifier, we construct a **confusion matrix** using **confusion_matrix** from `sklearn.metrics`.
The confusion matrix is visualized using **seaborn** to highlight where the model makes mistakes in its predictions. This approach gives us insights into which digits the model confuses most often. 

Overall, this process covers loading the dataset, preprocessing, training a model, and evaluating the results with a confusion matrix.

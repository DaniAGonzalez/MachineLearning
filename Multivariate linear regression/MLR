Multivariate Linear Regression for Predicting Home Prices and Salaries
This project demonstrates the application of multivariate linear regression to predict home prices and salaries based on multiple features. 
The first part uses the "homeprice.csv" dataset to predict house prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and house age. 
The second part applies linear regression to predict salary based on experience, test scores, and interview scores. 
The code includes data preprocessing (handling missing values) and feature encoding, followed by training and making predictions with the model.

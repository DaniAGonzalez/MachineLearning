Implementing Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
This code demonstrates two approaches for fitting a linear regression model to predict CS scores based on Math scores.
The first approach uses custom Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function and find the best-fitting line.
The second approach uses Scikit-learn's built-in LinearRegression model for comparison.
The implementation allows for comparison of the coefficient and intercept values obtained from both methods.

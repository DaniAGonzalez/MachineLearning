Predicting Housing Prices with Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression
This code demonstrates the process of predicting housing prices using the Melbourne housing dataset. It covers data cleaning, including handling missing values and categorical variables, followed by training a linear regression model. 
To address overfitting, Lasso and Ridge regression models are applied and evaluated. The models are compared based on their performance on a test dataset.Lie

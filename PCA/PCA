This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression to classify handwritten digits from the digits dataset. 
The process begins with exploring and preprocessing the data, where features are standardized using StandardScaler.
Then, a Logistic Regression model is trained on the scaled data and its performance is evaluated on a test set. 
Next, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of the variance, and the Logistic Regression model is trained again on the transformed data to compare performance before and after applying PCA.
This approach allows us to observe the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. 
The libraries used include sklearn.datasets to load the dataset, StandardScaler for feature scaling, PCA for dimensionality reduction, LogisticRegression for classification, and train_test_split to split the data into training and testing sets.
